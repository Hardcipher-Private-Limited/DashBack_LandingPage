                DashBack offers its Premium Members the opportunity to grow
                their savings through two investment plans. 
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Timed Plans:</b> These plans are designed to provide
                investors with a guaranteed return on investment at the end of a
                fixed term. They may be suitable for investors who want a fixed
                return and are comfortable committing their funds to the plan
                for a specific period. The amount of the return is typically
                determined at the outset of the investment. These plans have a
                fixed duration or term. At DashBack, these terms are 6 months
                and 12 months. The returns are delivered in the form of cash
                that, depending on the amount, is deposited into the investor’s
                DashBack wallet or bank account.
              </p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div className="col-lg-2 pt-5"></div>

          <div className="col-lg-5 pt-5">
            <div className="digital_card_text padding_for_texts">
              <p>
                <b>Flexi-Term Plans: </b>These plans are designed to provide
                investors with more flexibility and the potential for higher
                returns. Unlike Timed Plans, Flexi-Term Plans do not have a
                fixed investment term. Instead, investors are free to withdraw
                their funds at any desired point after 15 days without any
                penalty, making these plans a more flexible option for those who
                may need access to their funds in the short term.
              </p>
              <p>
                Both plans offered by DashBack are designed to help investors
                grow their wealth over time.
              </p>
              <p>
                The choice between the two types of plans will depend on the
                investor's tolerance, investment goals, and preferences.
              </p>
              <p>
                DashBack recommends that investors carefully consider their
                options and seek professional advice before making any
                investment decisions. For detailed information on these plans,
