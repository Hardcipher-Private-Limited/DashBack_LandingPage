             DashBack has entered into an agreement with the third party
          channels to provide the facilities of Demat and trading accounts.
          Hence users need to submit all the required documents to activate
          their Demat accounts.
          <br />      After the submission of all the documents, our team will
          verify the submitted documents and proceed for the Demat account
          opening process. Once the documents are verified and confirmed by our
          third party channels, the user will be counted as an ACTIVE USER.
               To remain ACTIVE means you need to do active trades in your Demat
          account. The numbers of trades may differ as per your type of
          membership plans. In our current plan, a <strong>FREE</strong> user
          needs to do 5 trades in a month and a <strong>PREMIUM</strong> user
          needs to do only 1 trade in a month.
