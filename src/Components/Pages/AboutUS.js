        <div className="AboutUs_header">Our Story</div>
        <div className="about_read">
          Three years ago, DashBack began as a third-party tie-up for those who
          were looking to build for themselves a comfortable nest egg by
          investing in the market via DEMAT accounts. Working as a facilitator
          to help open DEMAT accounts, we at DashBack enjoyed high commissions
          and re-distributed those commissions amongst our customers as
          cashback.
        </div>
        <div className="about_read">
          We established DashBack with one mission and one mission only- to help
          our customers save and earn more by giving them real, usable cashback
          as a reward for allowing us to invest their money for them.  Unlike
          our competitors, we kept only a sliver of these commissions for
          ourselves to help keep our lights on.
        </div>
        <div className="about_read">
          When Covid struck and markets all over the world took a hit, we
          started to feel the brunt of it much like every other business.
        </div>
        <div className="about_read">
          The lockdowns gave us time to think. And boy did we do some thinking.
          People lost their jobs, inflation grew steadily, and for most, it was
          becoming difficult to manage day-to-day expenses.
          <br /> So, we did what we knew (and still know) how to do best- we
          figured out more ways to give cash back to those who earned it in the
          first place. 
        </div>
        <div className="about_read">
          And so, the all-new DashBack was born. We now offer cashback on every
          transaction conducted on our app, be it a bill payment, a purchase, or
          even an investment. Every drop counts, and a decrease in expenditure
          means our customers can spend that “extra” cash where they’d like. 
        </div>
        <div className="about_last_line">
          We are committed to providing easier eCommerce, transparent cashback,
          and lucrative investment options for our customers.
