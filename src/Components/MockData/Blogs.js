It offers a wide range of services including mobile recharges, bill payments, and online shopping. Paytm also offers users a digital wallet that allows users to store money and make transactions easily.Paytm’s user interface is basic and to the point, with little to no regard given to user experience. It does have fast and secure transactions and offers cashback to its users, but the cashback offered is almost negligible and has too many strings attached. Along with that, it charges platform and transaction fees, thereby increasing the cost of transactions. Reaching out to customer service is also difficult; the representatives are too slow to respond.",

        <p>
          This strategy involves investing in stocks that have been performing
          well in the recent past. While this strategy can be profitable, it can
          also be risky if the market shifts and the momentum reverses.

        <h5>9. Contrarian Investing:</h5>
        <p>
          Contrarian investing is an interesting way of investing: investors
          place their bets on stocks that are out of favor with the market. By
          buying low and selling high, you can potentially benefit from a
          turnaround in the stock's performance.
